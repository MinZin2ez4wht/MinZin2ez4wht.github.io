      <h3 class="Ser_head"><b>What’s the difference between tequila and mezcal?</b></h3>
      <p class="Ser_Parag">Mezcal is a distilled alcohol made from agave plants. The heart of the agave plant, known as the piña, is cooked and roasted in a pit oven, which is where the signature smoky flavor of mezcal comes from. The roasted piña ferments and is then aged in oak barrels 
        (mezcal that is not aged is referred to as “joven”) and double 
     <br>Tequila is a mezcal specifically made from blue agave and must come from the Mexican state of Jalisco. The agave plant is also steamed rather than roasted, which is why tequila does not have that same smoky flavor as mezcal. Bottom line: Tequila is a mezcal,
         but mezcal is not a tequila.</p>

    <h3 class="Ser_head">Can I get tequila or mezcal delivery?</h3>
    <p class="Ser_Parag">Absolutely. Saucey delivers tequila and mezcal and anything else you might need to make your favorite cocktails
      straight to your doorstep, ASAP.</p>

      <h3 class="Ser_head">What are some good tequila and mezcal cocktails I can get for delivery?</h3>
      <p class="Ser_Parag">Obvs, margaritas are one of the most iconic cocktails of all time, and for good reason: a marg made with good tequila is really, really tough to beat. Palomas, a tequila-based cocktail that incorporates lime juice and grapefruit soda or grapefruit juice and soda water, are also very delicious. And of course, a good tequila absolutely can and should be sipped neat. Taking shots with salt and lime isn’t a traditional Mexican method of consumption,
         but whatever floats your mezcal boat.
      <br>A nice mezcal is likewise meant to be sipped neat, so all the complex flavors can be taken in. But swapping out tequila for mezcal in popular tequila cocktails is increasingly commonplace, so get after that mezcal margarita
         if you want it.</p>
